<h2>Local Access</h2>

<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.9.13 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebook, it can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.

<h2>Plans for updates</h2>

Change the heading on the sanity check section using HTML headers to be clear and concise about what the section accomplishes.
